# Find the minimum-area bounding box of a set of 2D points
#
# The input is a 2D convex hull, in an Nx2 numpy array of x-y co-ordinates. 
# The first and last points points must be the same, making a closed polygon.
# This program finds the rotation angles of each edge of the convex polygon,
# then tests the area of a bounding box aligned with the unique angles in
# 90 degrees of the 1st Quadrant.
# Returns the

# Tested with Python 2.6.5 on Ubuntu 10.04.4
# Results verified using Matlab
