"""
This script demonstrates interacting with the drake-visualizer application
from an external script over LCM . It doesn't require the directorPython
executable; instead, it can be run from a standard Python interpreter.

To demonstrate the visualizer, we construct a robot consisting of two links.
Each link has a single geometry attached: a rectangular prism for the first
and a sphere for the second. To spawn a model of the robot in the visualizer
app, we publish a viewer_load_robot_t() LCM message. To draw the robot in a
particular configuration, we publish a viewer_draw_t() message with the
position and orientation of each link in the robot.
